# CleanupShare-WithExcludes
Cleans a Share Folder by checking file age and removes them if the "-Remove" Switch is given.

This Script has also a possibility to exclude files and folders which should not be deleted.


Open taskschd.msc import the *.xml Task Schedule File and Place the Script and Exclude File correctly.

The Script and the Exclude Text File must be in the same folder. 
Logs are getting generated also in that very folder.
